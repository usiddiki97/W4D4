# Towers of Hanoi

# Write a Towers of Hanoi game.

# Keep three arrays, which represents the piles of discs. Pick a representation
# of the discs to store in the arrays; maybe just a number representing their
# size. Don't worry too much about making the user interface pretty.

# In a loop, prompt the user (using gets) and ask what pile to select a disc from,
# and where to put it.

# After each move, check to see if they have succeeded in moving all the discs,
# to the final pile. If so, they win!

# Note: don't worry about testing the UI. Testing console I/O is tricky (don't
# bother checking gets or puts). Focus on:
